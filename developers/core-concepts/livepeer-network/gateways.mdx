A Gateway (formerly known as a Broadcaster) on the Livepeer network is an entity
that facilitates video streaming or generative AI inference results to clients.
Gateways are responsible for routing transcoding or AI inference tasks from
their clients to the appropriate
[Orchestrator](/developers/core-concepts/livepeer-network/orchestrators.mdx)
nodes for processing. By running the
[`go-livepeer` client](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer), individuals can
join the Livepeer network as Gateways.

#### Configuration

Gateways do not need to stake
[LPT](/developers/core-concepts/livepeer-network/delegators#livepeer-token-lpt)
to participate in the network. They only
[require enough ETH](gateways/guides/fund-gateway.mdx) to cover the cost of
transcoding and AI inference jobs. Unlike Orchestrators, Gateways do not need a
GPU to participate. Any machine with a decent CPU and sufficient bandwidth can
operate as a Gateway.

Gateways are essential components of the Livepeer ecosystem, serving as the
bridge between the Orchestrators performing the work and the clients requesting
the work. They often provide additional services such as content delivery
networks (CDNs) and base currency subscriptions, ensuring that jobs are
delivered swiftly to the right client and that clients don't need to set up
crypto wallets themselves.
